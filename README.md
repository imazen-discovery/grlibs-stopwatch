# vips-stopwatch #

This is a small collection of programs which use the Vips library to
do some simple image manipulation, times how long various stages take
and outputs the results.

The goal is to get a basic idea of just how fast Vips is.

Built against libvips-7.26.3 on Ubuntu 12.04. This is the version of
libvips included with Ubuntu 12.04.
